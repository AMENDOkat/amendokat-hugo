I had originally planned for my first blog post on this site to be an "indie web manifesto", in the fashion of many other webmasters around here. If you don't know, an indie web manifesto is a piece of writing that details your thoughts on the indie web movement and social media as a whole, mostly explaining why you've decided to create a website and why social media sUckZx so much!1! But I found, through my current draft and all the ones that came before, that this issue is infinitely more complex than it may seem at a first glance. 

Social media is an incredibly nuanced topic to discuss, even with years of study it takes a while to make a draft that really means something. And, under my increasing desperation to publish this site that's been in the works for so long, I have postponed it. None of my current drafts cover everything that I want to discuss, to the degree I want to, and I feel it's holding back the site's release unnecessarily when I could just publish it at a later date.

So, here it is. My first post and it's not an indie web manifesto. I'm not exactly sure what to write. I've been wanting to make this site for so long and I had so many ideas for it - a lot of them, much like the manifesto, postponed because I was getting too desperate and just wanted to get *something* out there. I decided to make a website when I found out about Neocities around 2 years ago, since then, there's been about 3 drafts for it. Three times I've built the entire thing from the ground up, and now it's finally done.

There's a few reasons I can list about why I wanted to make a site. They're really cool, they make me look cool, they're incredibly helpful - being an artist, it's very handy to have some place where people can see all of my art, links and information - and it's a platform I can use to publish *anything else* I want. It's a lot less pressure too. I don't expect people to read this. It's a lot of work to click on someone's website and check their blog posts - I mean, it's not, but it's more work than the grand majority of the population is willing to put in. It's not any work for people to get my posts on Bluesky, I click "post" and they just show up on their feeds. It makes me anxious when I don't get any replies or likes back because *I know* people saw them.

It's nice to have a place to be myself and share my creations with the world without all that pressure social media puts on you. It's really nice, actually. It's a [cozy](https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Cozy_Glow) space I can call mine. It's also really gratifying making something and seeing the results of your work on the screen. I like working on the site, it's not in any way a chore. I do it *because* it's fun. If I just wanted a homepage, without any of the work, I would've just kept my [carrd](https://amendokat.carrd.co/).

I have so many ideas for the future here, you can check them out at the [roadmap](/site#roadmap-for-the-website-to-do-list-for-the-well-acquainted). And if you have any suggestions, I'd love to hear it! The site is mine, but I want it to be *for* everyone. I put work into making it performant, accessible and the code is completely [open source](https://github.com/AMENDOkat/amendokat). I believe the internet should be free and for everyone, and it's one of my drives for making this place. Sharing my skills and knowledge with the world for whomever may find them useful. Even if that knowledge is something "irrelevant" like what's my favourite brand of ready made cappuccino.

That's all I have to say for now. Websites are awesome and I wanted to make one. I take great pride in my work as I've put so much love and so many hours into it. And I want other people to enjoy it too, maybe not as much as I do, but to have a good time here nonetheless. 

see y'all next post glowers! stay glowing always :chess_pawn: :chess_pawn: :chess_pawn:
