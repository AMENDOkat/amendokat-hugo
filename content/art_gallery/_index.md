## Art Gallery
An incomplete, *for now,* collection of all my work. Ranging from 2023-current. 

I began posting on Instagram, later X, Tumblr, posted sparingly on Derpibooru and Bluesky. Nowadays, my X accounts are all gone because fuck nazis and my Instagram account is gone because fuck META. My only active social media accounts now are Tumblr and Bluesky. However, both accounts are heavily out of sync with each other and sometimes just straight up missing some of the drawings from Insta/X/Derpi. I have plans to slowly bring them, *and Derpi*, up to date with each other and upload all the missing artwork, but that's gonna take a *long* time. For now, this art gallery is here to fill the gap. Later on, It'll be used to post website exclusive content like abandoned projects, unreleased art and pre-2023 work that wouldn't be fitting on my actual accounts.  

*❝ My relationship with Derpibooru? ...it's complicated. ❞*
