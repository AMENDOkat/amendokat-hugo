I remember there was so much buzz around this piece when I posted it on X. A mutual I had made Chrysalis's horn out of clay and some guy even made a comic dub! It's the first time anything like this ever happened to me. Gosh I wish I could track that comic dub down... I don't have it saved anymore :(
