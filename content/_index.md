## Welcome websurfers!
Hi there! My name is Kat and I'm the webmaster that runs this domain. It's a hub of everything about me - my artwork, my writings, where to contact me, commission info, fun facts, not-so-fun-facts, my daily life happenings and much more. I built this temple for many reasons, for one, I wanted a centralized space about myself that is *my own*, without having to rely on the goodwill of my social media overlords to keep my content safe, but also for the reasons that most of you indie web netizens are here, it's a form of self expression and rebellion against the shit state of social media nowadays. Feel free to have a look around and I hope you enjoy your stay!
