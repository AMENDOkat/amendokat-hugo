## Welcome websurfers!
I'm Kat and this is my website. It's a hub of everything about me - my artwork, my writings, where to contact me, commission info, fun facts, not-so-fun-facts, my daily life happenings and much more. I built this temple because the indie web is awesome and the current state of social media is extremely depressing. Feel free to have a look around and I hope you enjoy your stay!
