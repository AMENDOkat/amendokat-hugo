## Who's the webmaster?
My name is Arthur, but online I go by Kat (he/him). I'm an artist, I mostly work with digital art, fan works but I have plans for OC content in the future. I've done a lot of MLP fan art in the past, specifically for the little pony pegasus Cozy Glow. I'm autistic and My Little Pony has been my special interest for years now, and I don't see that changing any time soon. I've had a number of hyperfixations in the past ranging from Azula from Avatar the Last Airbender, The Phantom of the Opera, The Wizard of Oz, Amity Blight from The Owl House and True Crime. *Please talk to me about any of them.* Besides for my drawings, I haven't really published anything, though I've written a few stories and coded a few things (mainly this website and all it's drafts) - I would really like to invest more time in those in the future, but don't have any concrete plans to do so as of now.

I'd rather keep my personal life separate from my online activity, so all **personal** information will remain private. A few things worth mentioning: I am a very political person, radical left, I talk about politics here and on all my profiles. I have *a lot* of *very* strong opinions about *a lot* of things. I'm a punk, but I'm also really into the goth subculture as well. I'm brazilian, which means english is not my first language. I am very queer I don't care about gender I like everyone, I am also a trans man. I'm a furry, a brony, and whatever other evil titles I can adopt. I am in fact employed and pursuing a higher education (calm down ladies I know). I'm also really good at [Be a Parkour Ninja](https://www.roblox.com/games/147848991/Be-A-Parkour-Ninja) on Roblox - or at least last time I played like... Two years ago, I was.

## My Art
I'm a hobbyist artist, I work mainly on digital. My illustrations have a really big focus in color, brush work and textures. Painting is my favorite part of the process, and what I consider my biggest strength as well. I put hours of work, love and dedication in every single one of my pieces, and I feel like they really show it.

Most of my work is fan art. Specifically My Little Pony fan art, specifically the character Cozy Glow, as I've been deathly obsessed with her and the show for quite a few years now. But occasionally I draw other media and even my own characters.

I've been working with art commissions for about two years now. If you'd like to get one, make sure to check out my commissions page for my prices and terms of service.

Drawing is very important to me and It's something that's helped me through many tough spots in life, it helped me meet wonderful people and build a nice little community online that I can call my own. I couldn't be more thankful to it.

## Coding
I'm a hobbyist programmer as well. Nowhere near where I'm at on my art journey, but I know a thing or too. My coding experience mostly comes from this website, it's two previous (now scrapped) drafts and a other minor things: bash/batch commands to automate a few tasks on my desktop, CLI applications such as [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)  and troubleshooting [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/). 

I don't do commissions or freelance coding work because I am not confident enough in my abilities as a programmer to do so. But if you have a question you think I might be able to answer, I'd be more than glad to help out.

I have definite plans to develop my coding skills as I would very much like to work on my own applications, contribute to my favorite open source projects and make an indie game.

As of now my plan is to pick up learning Python and Javascript.

## Where To Find Me
I barely use social media, the only place I'm really active on rn is Bluesky (I'd like to hang more on Tumblr but I just keep forgetting about it!). If you look up "amendokat" online you're gonna find many other accounts with my name on them, most of them are abandoned or barely ever updated so don't bother.

## Kat Trivia

### current hyperfixation?  
***TRUE CRIME!***  
It's terrible and I hate it. It's not something that's socially acceptable to post or "make content" about (draw). You can't talk about it with people either cause they're gonna think you're a freak (sexually) or a *freak* (threat to society). And the people you *can* talk about it with, 9 times out of 10 are not exactly someone you want around you.

### My hobbies: 
Drawing, coding, listening to music and archiving. I also like working on my media server. I've done other stuff in the past like sewing, playing guitar, editing, but they never really stuck with me.

### My music: 
I listen to basically everything, but there's a lot of metal and a lot of musicals. Here's a few I like!

My favorite musicals are Wicked, Heathers and Phantom of the Opera. But if I had to pick one, it'd definitely be phantom <3

I really like hardcore punk and death rock, my favorite bands respectively are Mukeka di Rato and Scary Bitches.

My favorite metal bands are KMFDM, Powerwolf and Sabaton. If you know anything about these bands, it's an easy guess that my favorite genres are power and industrial. ***KMFDM SUCKS!*** 

I also listen to a lot of other stuff. Game soundtracks, movie/tv show songs, war songs, folk punk, pop, mpb, country, cordel, etc, etc.


### My games: 
I'm not huge into gaming so my answers here are pretty basic. Games I like, in no particular order: Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption 2, Deltarune, DOOM/DOOM II (classic), Minecraft and Stardew Valley.

### Movies & Tv Shows:
Don't really watch movies unless I get hyperfixated on a topic.  

Kat's highest rated Tv Shows: My Little Pony, Avatar the Last Airbender and The Owl House (yes it's all cartoons, yes i'm an adult. it's ok, you can laugh, *it's funny*). "Normal people" shows I enjoyed: Dahmer and A Series of Unfortunate Events.

### A quote that stuck with me:  
"I see much of myself in you, Starlight Glimmer, and I can tell you from personal experience that things do indeed get better."

### are you mentally ill???
Yes! I have: depression, autism, anxiety, probably something else i don't know. adhd i guess too. it is a relatively common occurrence that i may disappear for weeks at a time and maybe even months because of bad episodes. don't take it personally and don't call the police to my house - im OK, i still like you, i just can't do anything.

### Another quote?
"*I'M THE ILLEGITIMATE SON OF GOD!!!*" 

### what do you think about  *insert random internet bullshit here *?
