## About this site

This site is written in Markdown and built using the static site generator [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/). Hosted on [Neocities](https://neocities.org/).

Designed for [Firefox](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/?redirect_source=mozilla-org) with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Originally built on Windows and later on the [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/) OS.

Open source, all code and assets are available on the [Github repository](https://github.com/AMENDOkat/amendokat). You are allowed to use and edit the code of this website freely. 
You are not allowed to edit any of the artwork or writings of my ownership featured here, reposts and other reproductions are allowed as long as credit is given. If you wish to edit my artwork or writings for any reason, please contact me so we can discuss it.

Files on Neocities are [minified](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/what-is-the-purpose-of-minification-in-web-development/) for better performance and to save space. For un-minified files visit the [repository](https://github.com/AMENDOkat/amendokat).

I do not support or condone the use of generative AI and it was not used during any point in the creation of this website or the content featured in it.

If you have any suggestions of features I can add to the site or code improvements, feel free to contact me. Or if you prefer, make a pull request or open an issue on Github.

If you encounter any bugs, broken links, or [chickens](/images/chicken.webp/), please contact me so I can fix them as soon as possible.
