*Dedicatória: Ao verme que primeiro roeu as frias carnes do meu cadáver dedico como saudosa lembrança estas memórias póstumas.*

I like the idea of this place being some sort of tomb after I'm dead. Now, I don't plan on dying soon, but if I do - if I change my mind or get into some freak accident - this is gonna be... Well it's gonna be very grim to navigate through that's for sure. I really like that thought though. It's like entering a house you know someone's been murdered in. A constant feeling of dread, always lurking in the air and like something's missing. I hope this website stays up for a long time after I die. As a memorial of the person I was and a time capsule of that period. Abandoned and frozen in time. Rotting away in some corner of the internet waiting for the domain to expire, much like my own mortal remains rotting on the ground waiting for the maggots to come and feast.
