## friendz and other cool peeps
Self explanatory.
- [The Cozy Glow Meme Account](https://bsky.app/profile/cozyglow.bsky.social)
	The hardest Cozy Glow memes on the web for your enjoyment. DAILY POSTS!!! Ran by my CBF(COZY BEST FRIEND!!!)
- [BigMacDavis](https://www.youtube.com/@BigMacDavis)
	I really like this guy's DOOM and Duke Nukem walkthroughs, he explains stuff really well and he has a nice voice. They're great background noise for drawing. His [Doom II (100%) Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLR2vpfke_UnCcn0aDEyzKTvzic07Vp70y) and [Duke Nukem 3D (100%) Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLR2vpfke_UnCMAvt62HNM32BrfK9nfpPJ)
- [DWK](https://www.youtube.com/@dwk2528)
	Brony who makes drunk recaps of MLP episodes. He abandoned the channel after quitting alcoholism, but *most* of the videos are still available to watch. My favorite videos are (predictable): [Totally Legit Recap: "School Raze" (Part 1) MLP Season 8 Episode 25 - DWK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wwQrwhAmTA) and [Totally Legit Recap: "School Raze" (Part 2) MLP Season 8 Episode 26 - DWK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-2AMU4c1Fk) (these two videos on the original channel were removed because Hasbro hates fun).
- [decino](https://www.youtube.com/@decino) 
	Fun and educational DOOM videos.
- [Chad Chad](https://www.youtube.com/@thechadx2) 
	One of the very few YT comedy channels I actually enjoy. Go check her out!
- [Mental Outlaw](https://www.youtube.com/@MentalOutlaw) 
	I don't particularly agree with some of the stuff this guy has to say, specially the whole AI bs, but I find that his videos on the dark web and opsec in general are actually very well informed and he's really good at explaining stuff so anyone can understand it. I would recommend his channel if you're ever interested in learning about those topics.

## web neeeigh-bors
Indie web neighbours with sites I like. If you wanna be added here just add my button to your site and lmk so I can link you back!
- [tinypaws](https://tinypaws.neocities.org/)
	Site about a chihuahua named Pixie. Lots of cute puppy pictures to look at!
- [dannarchy](https://dannarchy.com/)
	Great music taste and I like the retro look.
- [Mental Labour](https://mental-labour.neocities.org/)
	One of the inspirations for making this site, I love all the writing.
- [Petra Pixel](https://petrapixel.neocities.org/)
	Loads of resources for coding, tutorials and snippets. Helpful!
- [KID★WITH★THE★CHEMICALZ](https://kidwiththechemicalz.net/)
	Caught a vibe with this one.
- [ribo.zone](https://ribo.zone/)
	Free code snippets and I really like the effects on the images.
- [NomnomNami](https://nomnomnami.com/)
	This site has a lot of cool features I'd love to implement on mine in the future.
- [Vampire's Nest](https://lupinus.neocities.org/)
	Very graphic's heavy site and I think that adds so much charm to it.
- [DOOMROT](https://doomrot.neocities.org/)
	DOOM site. I like this one because it was made on Microsoft Frontpage 98. That's fucking sick and I'd love to give Frontpage a try myself one day.

## Cool websites
A few sites worth checking out.
- [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)
	*Who doesn't know THE internet archive?!?* In case you don't, It's an archive of "everything" that's on the internet. They also have old video games, magazines, books, movies, software etc. etc. *And* they archive webpages via the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/). All for free and for anyone to access. I couldn't even begin to explain the importance of the work they do for preservating media. It's the biggest, baddest, coolest archive on the webs.
- [Web Design Museum - Web Design in the 90s](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/web-design-in-the-90s)
	Great collection of archived websites from the 90s, features other eras of the internet as well.
- [Old Doom Sites](https://doomshack.org/olddoomsites.html)
	Self explanatory. A collection of links to old archived DOOM websites. Lots of cool 90s homepages to check out!
- [The Useless Web](https://theuselessweb.com/)
	Takes you to a random "useless" website, mostly little quirky browser games to play when you're bored.
- [Windows 93](https://www.windows93.net/)
	Browser game laid out like an old Windows operating system.
- [The World Wide Web project](https://info.cern.ch/)
	Browse the first website!

## Kat elected most awesome programs on the web
Software that I use, approve and recommend.
- [Firefox](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/?redirect_source=mozilla-org)
	Best browser on the web if you disagree that means you love Palantir.
- [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/)
	The best adblocker and annoyance-get-ridder you can get. You're never gonna see an ad again. Free, open source, doesn't work on Chrome (that's a positive for me), works seamlessly with Firefox.
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
	The most powerful video and audio downloader that exists currently. Completely free, open source and runs everywhere. *Every other video downloader out there is, 9 times out of 10, a wrapper of yt-dlp.* Yt-dlp is a command line application with a heap of options. If you're not very tech savvy or just don't wanna bother learning it, [Cobalt Tools](https://cobalt.tools/) is a great alternative. *CT is a yt-dlp wrapper and like all wrappers it's options are much more limited than the base program, i'd personally recommend you pick up yt-dlp directly, there's tons of support out there, the documentation is great, and it's incredibly reliable, you're never gonna have trouble when you need to download a video or song ever again.*
- [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/)
	Free, open source media library. It's like having your own offline Netflix and you can organize it however the hell you want. It's AWESOME!!! It also has a pretty large library of plugins, a personal favorite of mine is [Youtube Metadata](https://github.com/ankenyr/jellyfin-youtube-metadata-plugin). It grabs the JSON file you downloaded with your video (*[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) hint hint*) and makes Jellyfin process the info from that file so it thinks the video is just a standard movie or episode from a show you downloaded, which means it can actually organize and read them properly. For someone who's never used any program like this, it may seem stupid, but believe me, once you try doing anything web related in a media library like Jellyfin or Plex (JF but worse), you'll understand why this is a lifesaver. *Can you tell I'm into this stuff?*
- [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/)
	Best torrent software available on the webs.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
	Note taking app in markdown. Very complete, has an extensive online community and plugin library - anything you think you could ever think to do with a text file, Obsidian probably a way to do it. Would you believe me if I said most of the pages for this site were written there? When I was done I just dropped them into HUGO to do it's magic. Pretty cool, huh? If you're into writing or note taking this is a must have imo.
- [FreeFileSync](https://freefilesync.org/)
	Super easy to use and works the seamlessly on ~~Linux and~~ Windows. I use it to backup folders locally and move stuff between my phone and PC. It's a Windows native application so it has some weird issues on Linux, but it still works.
### honourable mentions
- [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/)
	Linux distro for beginners and my current main operating system. *i don't use arch btw*
- [Free Download Manager](https://www.freedownloadmanager.org/)
	My download manager of choice. I'm sure there's a better one out there, but I couldn't get used to any of the others I tried and FDM just works. Download managers are great because they speed up downloads, they let you pause and unpause them, plus they're good for organizing. No reason to not get one.
- [PostyBirb](https://www.postybirb.com/)
	Free program to post on multiple social media accounts at once. I use it for my art. Works with ko-fi, Bluesky, Tumblr, Derpibooru and others. Nice template and tagging functionality.
- [gallery-dl](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl)
	Like yt-dlp but for images. I have a love hate relationship with it. Not as powerful as yt-dlp, *ridiculously* hard to use and the documentation doesn't help because it FUCKING SUCKS. It's gonna give you a lot of headache, but if you wanna bulk download images, it's the way to go *unfortunately*.
- [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
	Used it to set custom keyboard shortcuts to folders I use a lot on my computer. It's Windows only and since Linux Mint natively supports setting custom keyboard shortcuts, without any crazy background tinkerings, I've abandoned it. It's here on this page mostly as a thank you, because back in my Windows days this guy was my right hand man.
- [Bulk Rename Utility](https://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/Download.php) Rename a bunch of files at once.

## my little ponies
MLP links everypony should know about! 
- [Yay Ponies](https://yayponies.no/) A bunch of MLP media available to download. Comics, books, the actual show, movies, fan works and much more.
- [Ember's MLP:FiM Archive](https://fim.heartshine.gay) Watch MLP online
- [The Pony Archive](https://theponyarchive.com/) A fan run project with the goal of archiving mlp fan works
- [Fimfiction](https://www.fimfiction.net/) THE pony fanfic site
- [Derpibooru](https://derpibooru.org/) The biggest MLP booru (if you don't know a booru is like an image board)
- [Desktop Ponies](https://github.com/RoosterDragon/Desktop-Ponies) Add ponies to your computer. What more could you possibly want? =D

## Resources
Resources to help build and populate your webpage.

### Learn Coding
- [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez)
	Great channel for learning if you're just getting started with HTML, CSS and JS. Do keep in mind though, I would only recommend his tutorials if you never had any contact whatsoever with these coding languages and have limited programming knowledge. Once you start to learn more, you realize he glazes over a lot of important concepts in order to keep the videos simple and understandable. Again, great for beginners, not so great if you already know some stuff. I started learning through his [HTML & CSS Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGTJBPNC-Gw).
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions)
	The three websites you're gonna see the most when searching up anything HTML, CSS and JS related. MDN Web Docs and W3Schools both feature documentation on all the different tags and functions ur gonna encounter on your coding journey. Mozilla's documentation is a lot more complete, but also harder to understand, for beginners W3Schools is better. Different from the last two, Stack Overflow is a forum for asking questions, chances are whatever weird quirk you have going on with your code, someone else's already encountered it before and asked that question there.

### Tools
- [Ezgif GIF compressor](https://ezgif.com/optimize)
	Ezgif is a great tool in general for working with and making gifs, but their gif compressor is a god send, specially when you have *very limited storage* for your site.
- [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)
	My go to favorite for compressing images, supports multiple file formats and has a great compression rate.
- [CSS Gradient](https://cssgradient.io/)
	Create a gradient on the site and just copy the code to yours. SO helpful!
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
	My text editor of choice for coding, probably the most popular one out there too. Lots of extensions to help you out. One of my favorites is the self explanatory [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker). [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) is a good alternative if you want VSCode without Microsoft's telemetry bullshit, still haven't had the chance to test it unfortunately. [Vim motions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) is a cool introduction to [vim](https://www.vim.org/) as it let's you use vim keybindings on VSCode - i'm still learning it.
- [Github](https://github.com/)
	**Not exactly for beginners** Must learn if you're serious about web development, but if you just wanna make casual sites, you can skip it. Very powerful tool, but at the very core of it, it's just uploading your site to a remote folder (repository) so you have a backup and nice list of changes you can revert back to if you mess up something. Github also offers free static website hosting via [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).
- [deploy to neocities](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-neocities)
	**also not for beginners** Automatically deploy your site from Github to Neocities.
- [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/)
	**I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS IF YOU ARE JUST STARTING OUT WITH WEB DEVELOPMENT** Hugo is a static site generator, it's pretty fast, super popular so there's lots of support out there and it's gonna help you automate *so much* dumb website making stuff. Pages are written in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) so it makes writing your blog posts and whatever else a much less daunting/intimidating task. Specially when you integrate it with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). If you're at a sort of medium level in your HTML/CSS/JS journey, I'd definitely recommend looking into SSGs.

### Hosting
- [Neocities](https://neocities.org/) Free static website hosting service.
- [Nekoweb](https://nekoweb.org/) Free static website hosting service, gives you more freedoms than Neocities does, but the community is considerably smaller.
- [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) Host a static website directly from a repository on GitHub.

### Graphics
- [Gifcities](https://gifcities.org/)
	If you want some cool old school graphics for your site you need to check this out. It's a search engine that searches for images on archived [Geocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities) websites.
- [Cool Text Graphics Generator](https://cooltext.com/)
	Generate cool text!
- [Old Windows Icons](https://oldwindowsicons.tumblr.com/)
	Blog with a great collection of old Windows icons, plus whatever other retro icons the author wanted to archive.
- [Windows 98 Icon Viewer](https://win98icons.alexmeub.com/)
	Windows 98 icons for your site.
- [The Horror GIF Necronomicon](https://horrorgifs.neocities.org/indexb)
	HORROR GIFS!!!
